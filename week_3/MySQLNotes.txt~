to start mysql: 
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server restart
 mysql.server restart
mysql -u root

to create back up of the database:
./mysqldump -u root ReservationSystem > /Users/cb-rhama/chargebee/training/week3/mySQL/backup_ReservationSystem.sql
to take the databse from the .sql file
./mysql -u root ReservationSystem < /Users/cb-rhama/chargebee/training/week3/mySQL/backup_ReservationSystem.sql
use -p (i.e root -p database) if the database has a password. this will prompt u to type a database password.

to view all the databases: SHOW DATABASES;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS southwind;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS southwind;
To change a database to default: use mySecondDatabase; 
show tables;
to create a table:
create table if not exists Person (
    -> ID int unsigned not null AUTO_INCREMENT,
    -> FName char(30) null,
    -> LName char(30) not null default "Doe",
    -> primary key(ID),
    -> foriegn key (column) references TableName(column) on update cascade on delete restrict on delete cascade;
    -> );
SHOW CREATE TABLE person;
Insert value into a table
INSERT INTO products (productCode, name, quantity, price) VALUES
		('PEC', 'Pencil 2B', 10000, 0.48),
		('PEC', 'Pencil 2H', 8000, 0.49);
INSERT INTO products VALUES
		(NULL, 'PEN', 'Pen Blue',  8000, 1.25),
		(NULL, 'PEN', 'Pen Black', 2000, 1.25);
INSERT INTO tableName SET column1=value1, column2=value2, ...

DESCRIBE person;

SELECT 1+1, NOW();
SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'P__ %';
				WHERE (price BETWEEN 1.0 AND 2.0) AND (quantity BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000);
				WHERE name IN ('Pen Red', 'Pen Black');
				WHERE productCode IS NULL;
				WHERE (productCost <> 200) and (serviceCost == 250);
				WHERE criteria ORDER BY columnA ASC|DESC, columnB ASC|DESC, ...
Skip the first two rows and display the next 1 row

SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price LIMIT 2, 1;

SELECT FName,count(ID) from person natural join customer group by FName order by Lname desc;
Besides COUNT(), there are many other GROUP BY aggregate functions such as AVG(), MAX(), MIN() and SUM().
WHERE cannot operate on group by and aggregate function so we use HAVING

WITH ROLLUP shows group summery

% and _ are used for string matching.

DELETE FROM tableName
DELETE FROM tableName WHERE criteria

ALTER TABLE products
		ADD COLUMN supplierID INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
		ADD foreign key (columnName) references table(columnName),
		DROP FOREIGN KEY key,
		DROP columnName,
		ADD COLUMN date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
		
UPDATE tableName SET columnName = {value|NULL|DEFAULT}, ... WHERE criteria

To copy table to file
 select * from customer natural join person into outfile "dest location" columns terminated by ',';

To copy file to table 
 LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'src location' INTO TABLE products COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ',';

Foreign key: ON UPDATE or ON DELETE
RESTRICT, CASCADE, SET NULL and NO ACTION

To know the default name of the foreign key.
SELECT
  constraint_name
FROM
  information_schema.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS
WHERE
  constraint_schema = 'ReservationSystem' AND table_name = 'bookings';
